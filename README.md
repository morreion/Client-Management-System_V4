I created this project as an learning opportunity and as a service to a friend who is a 
Natutopathic practisioner who wants to migrate his paper based system to an digital version.

I do make software as a hobby now, primarely C# WPF projects. 
Developing mainly card games, in unity as well, and some other learning projects, 
like building a Bit Torrent client

I do use AI agents to teach , analyze and debog the code. I first try to find the solutions myself first,
but ask for solutions when stuck. Use AI to analyze the code so its fully understood so i can replicate it 
with a full understanding of the code.

I did use a layout template for the design of the application from Github:
