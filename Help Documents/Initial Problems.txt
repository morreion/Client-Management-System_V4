This exception was originally thrown at this call stack: [External Code]
Inner Exception 1: DirectoryNotFoundException: Could not find a part of the path 'C:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Images\shutdown_mo.png'. I pulled this project from github. Is it because the path to this image file is different in the code then it is on my computer?


Yes, the exception is caused by a hardcoded absolute path 
to an image file (C:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Images\shutdown_mo.png) 
that does not exist on your computer. 

This is a common issue when projects reference resources 
using absolute paths instead of relative paths or project 
resources.


How to fix:

1.	Check the XAML Reference:
    Open MainWindow.xaml (or the file at line 111, as indicated in the error) and look for an Image or similar element referencing the image. It likely uses an absolute path.

2.	Use a Relative Path:
•	Place the image (shutdown_mo.png) in your project directory, ideally in an Images or Resources folder within your project.
•	In Visual Studio, right-click the image file in Solution Explorer, select Properties, and set Build Action to Resource.
•	Update the XAML to use a relative URI, for example:

 <Image Source="Images/shutdown_mo.png" />


 or, if in a subfolder:
  <Image Source="pack://application:,,,/Images/shutdown_mo.png" />


3.	Ensure the File Exists:
Make sure the image file is present in the correct folder in your project.



Summary:
The error is due to a missing file at a hardcoded absolute path. Change the image reference in your XAML to use a relative path and ensure the image is included in your project as a resource.
Would you like help locating the exact line in your XAML and updating it?


What’s happening:
•	Your MainWindow.xaml references several images using relative paths like Images/img_home.png.
•	The error message, however, refers to shutdown_mo.png in a folder outside your project directory.
•	The line number (111) in the error is approximate and may not directly correspond to an <Image> tag, but rather to the point in the XAML where the parser failed to resolve a resource.

Why you don’t see it:
•	The image reference to shutdown_mo.png is likely in a style, template, or resource dictionary (such as Button.xaml, Image.xaml, or another XAML file), not directly in MainWindow.xaml.
•	The error bubbles up to the main window’s initialization, so the line number is not always the exact line of the image reference.


How to Fix
1.	Search for shutdown_mo.png in your project:
•	Look in all XAML files, especially in the Styles or Resources folders.
•	You can use Visual Studio’s Find in Files feature (Ctrl+Shift+F) and search for shutdown_mo.png.

2.	Check the Images folder:
•	Ensure that shutdown_mo.png exists in the Images folder inside your project.
•	If it’s missing, add the image to the correct folder.

3.	Update the Image Reference:
•	If the image is referenced with an absolute path, change it to a relative path, e.g.:
 <Image Source="Images/shutdown_mo.png" ... />

•	Make sure the image’s Build Action is set to Resource.



Example: Fixing a Resource Reference
If you find something like this in a style or template:
<Image Source="C:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Images\shutdown_mo.png" ... />

Change it to:
<Image Source="Images/shutdown_mo.png" ... />


Summary:
The error is not in the <Grid> tag, but in a missing or mis-referenced image file, likely in a style or resource. Search your project for shutdown_mo.png, ensure it exists in the correct folder, and update the reference to use a relative path.

How do i search for the references for shutdown_mo.png, ? i'm using visual studio community edition 2022


To search for references to shutdown_mo.png in Visual Studio Community Edition 2022, follow these steps:
1.	Open the Solution in Visual Studio.
2.	Press Ctrl+Shift+F to open the Find in Files dialog.
3.	In the "Find what" box, type: shutdown_mo.png
4.	Set "Look in" to:
•	Entire Solution (recommended), or
•	Browse to your project folder if you want to limit the search.
5.	Click "Find All".

Visual Studio will display all occurrences of 
shutdown_mo.png in your solution, including XAML, 
resource dictionaries, and code files. 
You can then double-click any result to jump directly 
to the reference.



I found all the references --> Code	File	Line	Column <None Remove="Images\shutdown_mo.png" />	C:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Page-Navigation-using-MVVM-C#-Design-Pro\Source Code\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App.csproj	29	26 <Resource Include="Images\shutdown_mo.png">	C:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Page-Navigation-using-MVVM-C#-Design-Pro\Source Code\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App.csproj	82	31 ImageSource="/Images/shutdown_mo.png"	C:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Page-Navigation-using-MVVM-C#-Design-Pro\Source Code\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\Styles\Button.xaml	112	38 So the images use a relative path . I did set the build action of al the images in the Images folder to Resource , copy to Output Directory to Copy always and shutdown_mo.png is present in the Images folder


Great troubleshooting! Since you have:
•	The image present in the Images folder.
•	The image referenced with a relative path:
ImageSource="/Images/shutdown_mo.png"

•	The build action set to Resource and Copy to Output Directory set to Copy always.
But you’re still getting a DirectoryNotFoundException, here are the most likely causes and solutions:

1. Resource URI Format
In WPF, for images with Build Action: Resource, the correct URI is:
ImageSource="pack://application:,,,/Images/shutdown_mo.png"

or simply:
ImageSource="Images/shutdown_mo.png"

Do not use a leading slash (/Images/shutdown_mo.png) unless you are using the pack://application:,,,/ syntax.


2. Check the Folder Structure
•	Make sure the Images folder is at the root of your WPF project (not just in the solution).
•	In Solution Explorer, the path should be:
Page Navigation App (project)
└── Images
└── shutdown_mo.png

3. Check for Typos
•	Ensure there are no typos in the file name or extension (e.g., .png vs .PNG).
•	Windows is case-insensitive, but WPF resource loading can be case-sensitive.


4. Clean and Rebuild
Sometimes, Visual Studio caches old build data. Try:
•	Build > Clean Solution
•	Build > Rebuild Solution

5. Resource vs. Content
•	Resource: Embedded in the assembly, referenced as Images/shutdown_mo.png.
•	Content: Copied to output directory, referenced as Images/shutdown_mo.png (relative to executable).

For WPF, Resource is preferred for XAML image references.


6. Check the XAML Reference
In your Button.xaml (line 112), try changing:
ImageSource="/Images/shutdown_mo.png"

To:
ImageSource="Images/shutdown_mo.png"

Or:
ImageSource="pack://application:,,,/Images/shutdown_mo.png"

7. Check for Duplicate or Conflicting References
•	Remove any <None Remove="Images\shutdown_mo.png" /> from your .csproj file unless you have a specific reason for it.


Summary Table

Build Action	XAML Reference Example
Resource	    Images/shutdown_mo.png or pack://...
Content	        Images/shutdown_mo.png (relative to exe)


Try updating the XAML reference as above and rebuild.
If the issue persists, please share the relevant snippet from Button.xaml around line 112 for further analysis.

PS C:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Page-Navigation-using-MVVM-C#-Design-Pro\Source Code\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App> how do i make this application launch?


Thanks for sharing the error and your goal! Before we dive in, let me ask a couple of questions to tailor my help:

1. What’s your name, and how much experience do you have with 
   C# and .NET development?
2. Is there anything you’re interested in (shows, hobbies, etc.) 
   that I can incorporate into our lessons or explanations?

Once you answer, I’ll help you step-by-step to get your application launching and 
teach you about .NET versions and project setup along the way.


My name is Eric and i have a basic beginners knowledge of C# and .Net Development 
and at the moment am interested in creating layouts for a database application. 
THis open project is pullled from github and i wanted to use it as a possible 
layout for the database application. 

I have not much knowledge about C# wpf database application, 
and this project which is about a layout gives me some ideas
about how to implement it



Great to meet you, Eric! Thanks for sharing your background and interests. 
Since you’re interested in layouts for a database application and you’re 
working with a C# WPF project from GitHub,
 I’ll guide you step-by-step to get this project running and help you 
 understand how layouts work in WPF.

Let’s start by addressing the issue you’re seeing:

### What’s Happening?
- The warning you’re seeing means your project targets .NET 6.0-windows , 
  which is now out of support.
- You’re using the .NET 10 SDK, which can build older projects, 
  but Microsoft recommends updating to a supported version (like .NET 8 or .NET 10).
- Sometimes, projects targeting unsupported frameworks won’t launch, 
  especially if dependencies or SDK features have changed.



### Step 1: Check the Project’s Target Framework
Let’s find out which framework your project is targeting and update it if needed. Question for you: Would you like to learn how to check and update the target framework yourself, or do you want me to walk you through it step-by-step?

Please reply with:

- “1” if you’re confused and want a slow, detailed walkthrough.
- “2” if you kind of get it and want a moderate explanation.
- “3” if you got it and want to move on to the next step.
Once you reply, I’ll guide you through checking and updating the 
target framework so your app can launch!


Awesome, Eric! Since you’re ready to move on, let’s check and update the target framework for your project so it can launch successfully.

### Step 2: How to Check and Update the Target Framework 1. Find the Project File
In a WPF project, the target framework is set in the .csproj file. 

For your project, look for a file named something like Page Navigation App.csproj in the folder:
c:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Page-Navigation-using-MVVM-C#-Design-Pro\Source Code\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\Page Navigation App\

Awesome, Eric! Since you’re ready to move on, let’s check and update the target framework for your project so it can launch successfully.

### Step 2: How to Check and Update the Target Framework 1. Find the Project File
In a WPF project, the target framework is set in the .csproj file. For your project, look for a file named something like Page Navigation App.csproj in the folder:

```
c:\Users\admin\Documents\GitHub\Pag
e-Navigation-using-MVVM-C#-Design-P
ro\Source Code\Page Navigation 
App\Page Navigation App\Page 
Navigation App\
``` 

2. Open the .csproj File
Inside this file, you’ll see a line like:
<TargetFramework>net6.0-windows</TargetFramework>

This is what’s causing the warning.

 3. Update the Target Framework
Change that line to a supported version, such as .NET 8 :
<TargetFramework>net8.0-windows</TargetFramework>


Or, if you want to use the latest (and your SDK supports it), you can use .NET 10 :
<TargetFramework>net10.0-windows</TargetFramework>



4. Save the File
After making the change, save the .csproj file.

 5. Restore and Run
Open your terminal in the project directory and run:
dotnet restore
dotnet run

This will restore dependencies and try to launch your app


Your Task: Go ahead and open the .csproj file, update the <TargetFramework> to net8.0-windows or net10.0-windows , save it, and then run the commands above.

Once you’ve done this, let me know what you see on the command line! If you get any errors or warnings, copy them here and I’ll help you troubleshoot.

Would you like a hint on how to find the .csproj file, or are you ready to try it yourself?
