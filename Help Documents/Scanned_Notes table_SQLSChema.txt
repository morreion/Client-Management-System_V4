I've attached the sql file of my database in .md format. 
The Scanned_Notes table is linked to the Client table, 
in which 1 client can have many scanned notes. 

Do i have to create a junction table or how do i go about it in 
linking the 2 tables, or is the sql schema correct as it is now?



Based on the SQL schema you provided, the schema is correct as it is.

You do not need a junction table for this specific relationship.

Why?

In database design, the rule for relationships is:

One-to-Many Relationship (1 Client -> Many Notes):
You put a Foreign Key inside the "Many" table (the child table) 
that points back to the "One" table (the parent).

Your Setup: The Scanned_Notes table (the "Many") has a column ClientID 
that points to the Client table.

Result: This allows one Client to be referenced by unlimited rows in 
the Scanned_Notes table.

Many-to-Many Relationship:
This is where you would need a junction table.

Example in your schema: Med_Hx_Supplements. One Medical History has 
many supplements, and one Supplement (e.g., Vitamin C) appears in 
many Medical Histories. That is why you created a middle table there.

Verification of your Code

Your current code handles the link perfectly here:


CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS "Scanned_Notes" (
    "ScannedNotesID" INTEGER NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,
    -- ... other columns ...
    "ClientID" INTEGER NOT NULL, -- <--- This creates the link
    FOREIGN KEY ("ClientID") REFERENCES "Client"("ClientID")
        ON UPDATE CASCADE ON DELETE CASCADE
);

How it works in practice:

Client A (ID: 1) has 3 documents.

In the Scanned_Notes table, you will have 3 rows where the 
ClientID column = 1.

Client B (ID: 2) has 1 document.

In the Scanned_Notes table, you will have 1 row where the
ClientID column = 2.

Connection to your PDF Viewer Feature

This schema perfectly supports the "Lazy Loading" feature we 
discussed earlier.

To get the list of documents for the UI:


SELECT ScannedNotesID, Document_Name, Document_Date, Description 
FROM Scanned_Notes 
WHERE ClientID = @SelectedClientID;

To get the actual BLOB when the user clicks a document:


SELECT Scanned_Document 
FROM Scanned_Notes 
WHERE ScannedNotesID = @SelectedNoteID;

You are good to go!
